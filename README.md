#  okbluemer

a lightweight cross-platform bluetooth messaging application

##  **setup**
1. follow the install guide for your machine [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. make sure you perform the "Android setup" step, following the "iOS setup" step is unnecessary at this point
3. pull our project from the [repo](https://github.com/blade-of-grass/okblue)

## **installation**
### *building it yourself*
1. refer to the above "setup" step for instructions on setting up flutter, building for Android, and pulling the codebase
2. plug in a(n) android device(s) to your computer
3. ensure that [usb debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) is enabled on your device
4. navigate in a terminal to the location where the flutter project was pulled onto your machine
5. execute `flutter run` in the terminal (or `flutter run -d all` if multiple devices are connected)

### *installing a prebuilt apk*
please use this option if...
* the above steps aren't clear enough to build the project (please let us know if this is the case)
* you don't feel like setting up the development environment to install the apk

we've bundled a pre-built, debug, Android version of the application into the repository specifically for the above cases.

this application can be accessed [here](./app-release.apk)
